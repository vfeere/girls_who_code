<h1> The Runaway Dog, Harper </h1>
<h3> Once, there was a dog named Harper. At first, she was pretty afraid of her owners, but then she got used to them. One day, Harper had fun at the dog park. So she ran away. Fortunately, her owner's house was close to the dog park. So she ran there and played. And played. And played. (I think.) And when her owners looked for her, she hid. (Again, I think.) Then some person found her and sent her to ACC (Animal Care+Control). So since she was microchipped, ACC called her owners. And at 6:00, she returned home. The End.
