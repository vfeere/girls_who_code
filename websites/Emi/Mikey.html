<h1> A Bad Sickness </h1> <h2> 
Once, there was a dog named Mikey. One day, he got sick. His owners were VERY worried about him because he was an old, 10 year old dog. And the owners had only had him for... like... 4 months! He was usually walking around and eating A LOT (for he was a fat Jack Russel Terrior). But when he was sick, the owners had to carry him out of bed and put the food (literally) 2 milimeters from his snout. And he wasn't drinking water. When he went to the veteranary office, the vets said that he had an infection in some part of his stomach. So he was given an antibiotic to help fight off the infection. He was also given fluids. From what the owners stated, Mikey didn't enjoy the fact that there were tubes in him putting in fluids, (and making him look like a malformed balloon,) so he started to bark. And whine. And whimper. But it was all for the better... because he got better! He seemed to be saying or thinking, "I got skinny. fatten me up again!" He had went from 21.3 pounds to 17 pounds. He had put the pep back into his step!
